# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends 

## Overview of Project
In this project I analyzed the Kickstarter dataset and created pivot tables and charts to easily identify and break down the dataset. The Kickstarter data consisted of thousands of types of projects with additional information on how much money did the project raise, did the project meet its goal, and where the project was located. We could also see when the project was launched, what category the project was and even the number of backers the project acquired. By applying filters and pivot tables, we can more accurately analyze the data to determine which categories of production meet their goal more regularly, and we can better understand the timeframe of when these productions should start and with what budget. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project specifically is to help Louise find the best combination of factors to predict the most success her play can have. We will see when she should launch her play, how much she should expect to allocate for fundraising, and any challenges she will face during the making of her play.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In one sheet, I created a pivot table  and then a ![line chart](<img width="332" alt="Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100726716/157292009-e7fb7321-b361-458f-a9d7-026637e10e99.png">) to visualize the type of project outcome based on when the project began. The information included as found in the chart Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date shows the date the project was created on the x-axis and the count of outcomes on the y-axis. The line graph then shows the data of successful, failed, and canceled projects with the successful projects always being greater than the failed projects with varying degrees of success. The successful projects are the highest in the month of May followed by June, and the failed projects have much less variance but are highest in May followed by July.  
### Analysis of outcomes Based on Goals
In a separate sheet, I created a table and then a ![line chart](<img width="419" alt="Outcomes_vs_Goals" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100726716/157292745-0b66b6c1-ce49-4367-bba9-487c4c70ef4a.png">) to visualize the percentage success of a project based on the range of the funding goal of the project. Using the COUNTIFS function in excel, I filtered data of plays in the Kickstarter dataset that were successful, failed, or canceled in certain goal ranges. The chart shows that when the budget is the lowest, the success rate of the project is at its highest. Additionally, as one could assume, the projects with the highest 2 goal ranges were failed at the highest percentage. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Personal challenges that I encountered were issues with creating the COUNTIFS statements in the Deliverable 2 content. It took me a bit to grasp the equation, and it took me writing out the equation details a few times to break it down and look at each part separately. Once I was able to do that, I grasped the concept and was able to create the dataset with the function. I also struggled early on with filtering the dataset, simply because the data was so large, and I would get lost in the data. I eventually was able to filter the data easily and completed the tasks. 

## Results
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion is that the months of May-July have the 3 highest counts for created theater projects. With this data we can see that the success of theater projects has the highest value in the month of May. The most theater projects are started in the month of May, and the most are successful in the month of May. Another conclusion I came to, is that in the months of November and December, the total count is at its lowest and the ratio of successful to failed projects is much closer to 50%. I would conclude it is best not to start the project in either of these two months.
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
My conclusions of the Outcomes Based on Goals are that Louise should shoot for a funding goal of either less than $1,000 or from $1,000 to $4,999. At a goal of less than $1,000 the percentage successful is at its highest of 76% and has the lowest percentage failed at 24%. If Louise would like to increase the goal raised to a maximum of $4,999, the success percentage drops to 73% making the failed rate rise to 27% which is still good for the second lowest failed rate. In terms of conclusions, if the goal stays below $5,000 the project has the highest chances of success. 
### What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations of this dataset include not knowing how the productions fared after they were completed and if the production was successful in making money or not. Helpful data would have included if the play managed to make more money than it cost to create, and whether plays fared better with low goals or high goals. Having the result data would have helped draw more conclusions on which production Louise should choose. 
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
One graph I thought about adding would be pie charts comparing the percent successful to unsuccessful and canceled for certain criteria. For example, we could have included pie charts in the plays category for a certain goal of money to visualize how the percentage of success vs not.
